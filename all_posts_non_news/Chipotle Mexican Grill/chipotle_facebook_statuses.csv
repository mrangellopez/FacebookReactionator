In avocado groves at harvest time, every avocado is picked by hand to avoid bruising the fruit or letting any hit the ground. Then they‚Äôre carefully sorted and checked by hand for defects, blemishes and bruises before being gently packed for shipment to grocery stores and restaurants. When the avocados reach our restaurants, they‚Äôre hand washed, hand cut, hand scooped, and hand-mashed. Like all things hand-made, that extra effort translates into extra cost, but also into extra deliciousness.

My great grandfather emigrated from Switzerland and homesteaded as a farmer in Wyoming. Then my grandfather moved to the Blackfoot, Idaho area, and our family has been here ever since. We‚Äôre primarily dairy farmers, but also grow alfalfa hay and barley‚Äîplus we occasionally let our neighbors plant potatoes on our land, because we‚Äôre neighborly like that, and it also helps the soil. I really love the Blackfoot area and farming. It‚Äôs just beautiful out here in its own right, but also just a couple of hours away from Yellowstone and Jackson, Wyoming. After going away for college, I chose to come back and work on the farm anyway. Nothing else can compare to the independence of farming and the freedom of it. Over the years I‚Äôve also had the opportunity to grow and expand our business, and frankly it‚Äôs a great way of life for raising a family. I‚Äôve got 3 kids and 11 grandchildren, and while not all of them live here, they all spend time working with me on the farm throughout the year. We‚Äôre a small- to medium-sized family farm, with about 160 milk cows and around 350 head of cattle total. All of our dairy cows have access to pasture year-round. We feel our cows are healthy and happy because of that‚Äîthey get exercise and they get to go outside and graze whenever they want. We have 36 dairy farms in our Snake Valley Dairymen Association, mostly in eastern Idaho with a few in western Wyoming. One of the great things about working with Chipotle is that their pasture-raised dairy program, and the premium they pay for our milk, has really helped support our area and the farmers in the co-op. Their insistence on sourcing the best ingredients for their food is helping to support smaller farms and rural communities. We have a Chipotle now down in Chubbuck outside of Pocatello, just a half hour away, and we make it a point to go whenever we‚Äôre down there.
