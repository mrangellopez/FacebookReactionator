After Bonnie Kandel’s 7-year old son Leif, who has autism, saw a classmate with a McDonald's Teen Titans Happy Meal toy at school he knew he wanted one for himself. When he and his mom walked into the Speedway, IN restaurant last week, they learned that the current Happy Meals toy was Lego Batman instead of the Teen Titans toy that Leif wanted so badly. Bonnie explained to TQ how much the toy meant to Leif and TQ quickly took action, working with her manager and taking time out of her day to find the toys for Leif. According to his mom, Leif’s excitement was notable, he sleeps with them and takes them with him whenever they leave the house. 
 
Through her actions, TQ demonstrated to all of us that even the smallest things can make a big difference in the lives of other people. She showed us that she’s not only a great crewmember who takes care of every customer, but also a great person who understands how inspiring kindness can be. TQ is an inspiration and McDonald’s is proud to be a part of an amazing story!
