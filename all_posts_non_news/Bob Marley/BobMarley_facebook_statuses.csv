‚ÄúI came [to London] in 1974 on the Jamaican Showcase with Dennis Brown, Toots & The Maytals, and a young Sly Dunbar. Sly was playing in a band called Skin, Flesh & Bones with Lloyd Parks on bass, and Ranchie [Mclean] andTarzan [Nelson]. Cynthia Richards was on the tour as well, and Al Brown, singing Here I Am Baby.

When it started the tour was called Jamaican Showcase. This guy from the Greyhound was involved. Danny from the Greyhound and his lady Joanne ‚Äì they were the ones that put the tour on.

There was this promoter in London called Admiral Ken. He asked for me and Dennis Brown from the tour and he put us together with Desmond Dekker for a show in the Empire Ballroom, which was a sold out show.

Bob Marley came that night. Bob Marley, Familyman and Carlie the drummer (Familyman‚Äôs brother). At this time Bob Marley was promoting the album 'Catch A Fire' and he was backstage and I called him onto the stage and introduced him to the crowd.

I‚Äôve got a picture at home of me and Bob, Empire Ballroom 1974. But because I was a star at the time, the cameraman didn‚Äôt take a frontal of Bob, he took the frontal of me.

He went behind Bob and took the picture. I asked him after that, 'didn‚Äôt you have a frontal of Bob?' and he said, 'no!' because it wasn‚Äôt Bob‚Äôs show. Bob wasn‚Äôt big at the time. Can you believe that?‚Äù",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BobMarley/photos/a.312248430756.183051.117533210756/10155844552730757/?type=3,2017-08-25 17:49:46,5836,50,250,5554,233,39,7,1,2,0

""I went to Bob Marley‚Äôs legendary gig at the Lyceum in ‚Äô75 which was released as a live album. It was the closest I have ever got to a religious experience and the single most exciting music moment of my life. The full impact and reality of what we had heard on his records all came together in that show. It was no longer an abstract thing that you could interpret one way or another. Here was the man onstage delivering it live and direct. It gave me the confidence to be myself. Bob Marley brought the politic to the forefront of reggae with a militant Rasta rebel vibe. After the gig I followed Bob Marley in my car back to his hotel in Harrington Gardens, off Gloucester Road. I don‚Äôt know what possessed me, I marched into the hotel with all the other Rasta brethren. Everyone was sitting down and I found a little spot in the corner. Bob was holding court in his room and was smoking and ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô with all the Rasta elders. Finally, it was three or four in the morning and Bob had out-reasoned and out-smoked everybody. He looked around the room and saw me with my baby dreads and my pathetic little bag of smoke. I was called to the table and ‚Äòreasoned‚Äô with him until sunrise.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/BobMarley/photos/a.312248430756.183051.117533210756/10155181293315757/?type=3,2017-02-24 19:00:01,28795,168,1587,27416,1279,83,12,4,1,0

Story from Derrick Morgan: Leslie Kong sponsored the ""Derrick Morgan Farewell Shows"". Marley was on both bills, amongst John Holt, Frank Cosmo, Pluggy & Beryl, Roy Panton and others. Derrick made certain that Bob would be featured in the shows, though Derrick noticed that Bob (perhaps nervous) did not have a balance and unison with his performance energies. At the Capri show ‚Äúwhen Bob go on stage he was dancin‚Äô more than he was singin‚Äô‚Ä¶ And ‚Äòim come back to vocal, so mi beg ‚Äòim and se, ‚ÄòNo youth. When you sing two verses you dance, and then you go back to your other verse.‚Äô‚Äù At the Montego Bay venue, Bob performed as Derrick had suggested. Nonetheless, ‚ÄúOne Cup of Coffee‚Äù did not receive the audience responses that either of them expected. In fact, the typically volatile and expressive Jamaican crowd started to boo. ‚ÄúThe next song, ‚Äòim just get up and se, ‚ÄòJudge not, before you judge yourself.‚Äô When ‚Äòim reach de part de, the audience ray and se, ‚ÄòWait, this boy a bad, ‚Äòim a just mek a sound offa we!‚Äô Same time, yeah man, and a de so ‚Äòim hit.
