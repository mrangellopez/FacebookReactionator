The goal this weekend is to make photographs and videos of the people, places and things that inspire you.

Show your muse. Whether it‚Äôs the fashionable friend who pushes you to try new styles or your grandfather, whose handwritten cookbook houses all your family‚Äôs favorite recipes, show us who (or what) has inspired you to step up your game or try something new.

Take us there. A striking sunrise makes an early morning hike worth the wake-up time. A new exhibit at a museum can push you to revisit your love of painting. Share the locations that motivate you to step outside your comfort zone.

Honor the inspired work. Have a piece of art or new hobby with a story? Show us what you‚Äôve created, and tell us what encouraged you in your caption.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinspired hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Additionally, you can now also control replays. Choose ‚ÄúOne View‚Äù for messages you want your friends to only see once. For everything else, choose ‚ÄúAllow Replay‚Äù so your friends have more time to view your messages.

Going live with a friend is now even easier. Starting today, when a friend is live, you can let them know you‚Äôd like to join in the fun and hang out live together.

When watching a friend‚Äôs live video, simply tap the ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù button in the comments section. You‚Äôll see a confirmation that your friend has accepted your request, and you‚Äôll have a moment to prepare. Once you‚Äôre live, the screen will split in half so you can hang out live with your friend. You can leave your friend‚Äôs live video at any time, making it easy to join for a quick hello or a longer chat.

When hosting your own live video, you can easily see requests from friends who want to join. In the comments section, you‚Äôll see a notification for each request. Just tap the ‚ÄúView‚Äù button and then choose to add your friend or cancel the request.

The new icon with two smiley faces will also have a red number showing how many requests you have. Tap the icon, and you‚Äôll see both requests and current viewers. You can either accept a request or invite a viewer to join you. 

As always, you can remove a guest and add someone else at any time. When you‚Äôre done, you can share your live video to stories, or choose ‚ÄúDiscard‚Äù and your live video will disappear from the app as usual. 

Going live together is the best way to connect in real time and have fun with friends, even when you‚Äôre not together. With this update, friends have even more ways to quickly join each other‚Äôs live videos.

Light, camera, action! This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that showcase light in beautiful and diverse ways, as in this featured photo from Nadia (www.instagram.com/laporterouge). Here are some tips to get you started:

Light transforms ordinary scenes into extraordinary ones. Take a photo of the morning light as it pours into your kitchen, or during a sunset stroll. 

Have an outdoor portrait session with a friend. Try going during the golden hour, or find a perfectly and naturally illuminated wall to use as your backdrop.

Play with time and light together by photographing the same subject in the morning, afternoon and evening. Use multi-post to show how the light changes the scene throughout the day.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfindthelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Some things are just better together. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture duos that complement and enhance each other, as in this featured photo from Mark Abramson (instagram.com/markabramsonphoto). Here are some tips to get you started:

A hammock and a book, coffee and bagels, two best friends ‚Äî some things just naturally go together. As you go about your weekend, take photos of some of your own perfect pairs.

Not every match is so simple! Keep an eye out for more surprising duos ‚Äî much like this pedestrian and matching billboard ‚Äî that might be hidden in plain sight. 

Once you‚Äôve found an interesting pairing, how can you use camera tools to further enhance the match? Try taking a #Boomerang of two running buddies or a video of a dog and cat strolling through your backyard.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperfectpair hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Change is in the air. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos capturing the signs of a new season, as in this featured photo from Daniel Taipale (instagram.com/dansmoe). Here are some tips to get you started: 

Whether you‚Äôre in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern, nature transforms the landscape this time of year. Head outside to seek inspiration in your surroundings ‚Äî from the fiery reds and oranges of fall to the bright greens and blues of spring. 

What are your favorite activities in the upcoming season? Show us how you welcome the new season through traditions like autumn pumpkin-carving or planting a new garden. 

Reflect on what other transitions are taking place in your life, from new classes to new sports seasons.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPseasons hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Whether you‚Äôre trying to plan tomorrow‚Äôs outfit, choosing which class to take or figuring out where to go for dinner, now it‚Äôs easy to share a two-option poll right in your story.  After you‚Äôve taken a photo or video for your story, select the ‚Äúpoll‚Äù sticker and place it anywhere you‚Äôd like ‚Äî you can write out your own question and even customize the poll choices.

After you‚Äôve shared your poll, your friends and followers can immediately start voting and see real-time results. Once someone has voted on your poll, they‚Äôll see which choice is in the lead at any given moment. And if they watch your story again later, they‚Äôll see the latest results.

To see your own poll results, swipe up to open the viewers list for that part of your story. Not only will you see how many votes each option received, but you‚Äôll also see who voted and what option they chose. That way, you‚Äôll be able to compare votes from the friends and followers whose opinions you trust most.

162454007121996_1712158278818220,"Today, we‚Äôre announcing new tools and programs to keep Instagram a safe and positive place for self-expression. Since the beginning, we‚Äôve tried to make Instagram a welcoming place for everyone. Our community has grown to 800 million, with 500 million using it every day. It‚Äôs more important than ever to strengthen our commitment to safety and kindness.

Comment Controls

Over time, we‚Äôve launched a number of tools to help you manage the comments experience, and today we‚Äôre introducing more. Starting today, if your account is public, you‚Äôll see a new way to choose who can comment on your posts ‚Äî from everyone to just groups of people, like people you follow or your followers. Also, whether your account is public or private, you‚Äôll be able to block other accounts from commenting on your posts. In June, we launched a filter to block certain offensive comments in English, today we are expanding this filter to Arabic, French, German and Portuguese. The filter will improve over time, enabling the community‚Äôs experience of sharing to improve as well. 
  
Anonymous Reporting for Live Video

We‚Äôre continuing to provide mental health resources to you when you need them most. If you see someone going through a difficult time or in need of support during a live broadcast, you can report it anonymously. The person will see a message offering help with options to talk to a helpline, reach out to a friend or get other tips and support. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to respond.

Kindness Walls and Stickers

Over the next few months, we‚Äôre turning walls in cities around the world into colorful murals inspiring #KindComments. Visit a wall, take a photo or video and share a #KindComment to make someone‚Äôs day. You can also participate by using a new kindness-themed heart-shaped sticker. Both the murals and stickers are created by artists from the global community. 

We feel as strongly about creating a safe and welcoming environment today as we did when our community was just getting started. To learn more about these tools and others, visit Instagram-Together.com. Thank you for being on this journey with us, and for taking care of each other.

Ready, set, go! This week, the goal is to create photos and videos that capture energy and movement, as in this featured photo by Filipe Costa (instagram.com/filipefoto). Here are some tips to get you started:

Use Instagram‚Äôs creative tools to showcase kinetic energy in your daily life. Try a Boomerang of a morning running group or a Hyperlapse of an arena filling up with fans. Or make a Rewind in Instagram Stories of your dog playing fetch then share your video to your feed. 

Decide on a type of movement you want to focus on ‚Äî sporting events, urban commutes, fall activities like apple picking ‚Äî and go get in on the action. Let your camera lens draw your eye toward the most animated parts of the setting. 

Consider a scene that might at first glance appear calm and still. Where can you find the subtle forces of energy, and how can you highlight them in a single image?

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdynamic hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Nothing inspires creation quite like the beauty of nature. This weekend, the goal is to head outside and capture moments celebrating the great outdoors, as in this featured photo by Austin MacKay (instagram.com/austin.mackay). Here are some tips to get you started:

Are you heading out this weekend for some camping, hiking or biking? No matter what hemisphere you live in, the seasons are hinting at change, making it the perfect time of year to get outside. Take photos of your favorite moments.

The outdoors come in many shapes and sizes, from a backcountry trek to a small urban garden. Show us your own slice of nature, big or small. 

Getting outside can often require a fair amount of preparation and consideration ‚Äî packing gear, studying maps and preparing food. Show us your process through videos and Boomerangs. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgreatoutdoors hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Magic happens in the kitchen. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of the good food and better company you find in the kitchen, as in this featured photo by Hedi Gharrat (www.instagram.com/h.rebel). Here are some tips to get you started:

Visit the kitchens where your favorite meals are made: Re-create a family recipe at a relative‚Äôs house, capture the tried and true pots and pans hanging above your kitchen sink or the scars on a friend‚Äôs cheese board at Friday night dinner.

People tend to gather in a home‚Äôs kitchen. Record Boomerangs or videos that capture the energy of a group of family members and friends around food and drink.

Kitchens don‚Äôt have to exist between four built walls. What are some nontraditional, makeshift kitchens you found yourself in this weekend, like a street food cart or a campfire?

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinthekitchen hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Highlight how you‚Äôve added your own personality to a skill, or taken what you‚Äôve learned to a new level ‚Äî such as adding custom art to your musical instrument, or adding a new step to a dance routine.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve taken lessons for years or if you‚Äôre self-taught, use your caption to celebrate your progress and how far you‚Äôve come.

This weekend, the goal is to create photos and videos that show duplicates of different people, places and things, like in this image by @yagazieemezi. Here are some tips to get you started:

Keep your eyes peeled for repeating patterns, be it on clothing, in food or in nature. You might be surprised how many colors and shapes you find.

Use product tools to highlight duplicates ‚Äî a dog digging holes in the sand in Rewind, a Boomerang of a friend juggling a handful of lemons or a Hyperlapse of office workers strolling by, all dressed in suits and carrying briefcases.

Create your own intentional scene of multiplicity. Try dressing friends and pets alike at home, or create a work of art with echoing themes and colors. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmultiply hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Look for pops of light against a dark background ‚Äî fireworks, sparklers and bonfires included. Don‚Äôt forget to check out what the light is touching, as well as the light itself. 

Focus on the shine of different surfaces and textures, whether you‚Äôre in a building made of glass or on the shores of a lake watching the sunset sparkle off the water. 

Use Boomerangs or videos to capture the movement of a sparkle as it bounces around a room.

Many of you have told us that toxic comments discourage you from enjoying Instagram and expressing yourself freely. To help, we‚Äôve developed a filter that will block certain offensive comments on posts and in live video. You can turn this filter off in the ‚Äú...‚Äù settings menu from the profile and scroll to tap ‚ÄúComments.‚Äù  We‚Äôll launch this in English first, but will offer it in more languages over time. The spam filter removes any obvious spam in comments written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Chinese.

These filters are powered by machine learning, trained by our team to recognize certain types of offensive and spammy comments so you never have to see them. They will improve over time, enabling the community‚Äôs experience to improve as well. 

Our work is far from finished and perfect, but I hope we‚Äôre helping you feel safer and more welcome on Instagram.

Your profile is a representation of who you are and evolves with you over time. With Archive, you now have more flexibility to shape your profile while still preserving moments that matter.

To archive a post you‚Äôve already shared, tap ‚Äú...‚Äù at the top of the post and choose ‚ÄúArchive.‚Äù You‚Äôll still be able to see it when you tap the Archive icon in the top right corner of your profile. That way, you can always return to these posts and see previous likes and comments from friends. If you change your mind about a post you‚Äôve archived, tap ‚ÄúShow on Profile‚Äù at any time and it‚Äôll show up in its original spot.

With this update, you now have a space just for you, where you can revisit moments without having to keep them all on your profile.

162454007121996_1592548024112580,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPfriendship

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture the many aspects of friendship. Here are a few tips to get you started:

Consider the different ways that friendship can be represented ‚Äî not just through photos of friends themselves, but how relationships manifest in objects and actions. Take a photo of a thoughtful gift you were given, or a Hyperlapse of a helpful friend painting your kitchen with you. 

Show friends coming together, from gathering around the dinner table for a shared meal to a pickup soccer game. 

Keep an eye out for surprising or unlikely friendships: a dog and a cat snoozing together in a sunspot, a vine reaching out for a neighboring tree or a child embracing her new toy.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfriendship hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured photo by @harlis_gie,link,http://trib.al/6sdId9D,2017-06-09 18:02:23,164,11,8,152,8,1,1,1,1,0

Mirror, mirror, on the wall! This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of reflections, both man-made and naturally occurring. 

Here are tips to get you started:

Notice reflections in all different surfaces around you. Whether it‚Äôs a freshly polished mirror, a cup of coffee or a smooth lake, there are reflections ready to be captured everywhere.

Play with different forms of photography. A reflection that‚Äôs full of life and motion is an opportunity to experiment with Boomerang, reverse video or Hyperlapse. 

Pay attention to light and how it changes throughout the day. This will affect the brightness, quality and movement of the reflections you see around you. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPreflections hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

There‚Äôs no place like home. This weekend, the goal is to celebrate home in all its forms ‚Äî the people, the places, the things ‚Äî and what makes them feel special.

Here are some tips to get started:

Take a portrait of your parents, siblings or the loved ones you grew up with. Work to tell their story in a single photograph. 

Notice the little details. Whether it‚Äôs your mother‚Äôs favorite books lined up on the shelf, the table that you‚Äôve eaten dinner around since you were a child or a tire swing in the front yard, consider the specific elements that make it feel like home. 

Get creative with video to capture the smells, sounds and tastes of your hometown. How can you show what you would otherwise have to be there to experience?

Your dreams encapsulate your highest goals. This weekend, the goal is to capture that reach-for-the-stars feeling with photos and videos. 

Here are some tips to get started: 

Are you training to run your first marathon? Take a video that moves along your favorite route. Starting your own business? Capture the process of making the goods you‚Äôll sell with a Boomerang.

Notice other people around you who are working to achieve their dreams. You‚Äôll see that successes big and small are happening all around every day ‚Äî a daughter graduating from university, a baby taking their first step ‚Äî if you only take the time to look. 

Document your own dreams that have already come true. Photograph your newly purchased home or a plane ticket to a destination that changed your life.
 
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdreambig hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For some, the world goes to sleep at night. For others, it comes alive. This weekend, the goal is to capture both sides of that spectrum: the bright energy and the quiet rest.

Here are some tips to get you started:

Whether it‚Äôs calming down or speeding up, notice how the energy shifts. Document your family settling in for dinner or take a Boomerang of your friends hitting the town. 

Focus on light. Whether it‚Äôs the blue hue of dusk spreading over your neighborhood or a city skyline illuminated against the night sky, notice how light changes and evolves from bright to dim. 

Look beyond your immediate circle ‚Äî how do other people react to the shift from day to night? Take a portrait of a server heading to work or a video of downtown streets emptying as office workers head home.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgoodnight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

Our planet is a timeless source of discovery, wonder and inspiration. This weekend, let‚Äôs celebrate Earth‚Äôs beauty. 

Here are a few tips to get you started:

Spend time in a majestic landscape. Mountains, beaches, plains, forests ‚Äî our land is diverse and grand, and it would take lifetimes to experience it all. How much can you capture within the frame of one photograph or video? Look for action and movement within the larger scene.

Focus on the smaller details. Our planet may be vast, but there are millions of tiny, beautiful moments playing out in front of us every day: a blooming flower pushing through the cracks in the sidewalk, a trickle of water feeding a small pool in the forest or a tree swaying gently in the breeze. 

Keep an eye out for how nature weaves its way into man-made scenes. City and country alike have their own elements of natural beauty.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnaturalbeauty hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

You can create and name a new collection when you save a post, or you can add it to one you‚Äôve already created. You can also create a collection out of your existing saved posts. Tap the plus icon in the top right corner, give your collection a name and select the saved posts you‚Äôd like to add. 

You can find your collections on the saved posts tab on your profile. Just like all saved posts, your collections are private ‚Äî only you can see them. Since we introduced the ability to save posts last December, 46 percent of Instagrammers have saved at least one post. Whether you want to plan your next day trip, revisit your favorite artists‚Äô illustrations or always have some animal videos on hand, collections can help you keep track of the posts you want to remember. 

To learn more about save collections, check out the Instagram Help Center: https://help.instagram.com/274531543007118.

Over 200 million people now use Instagram Stories every day to keep up with friends and accounts they love. And with recent updates to Direct, it‚Äôs never been easier to have playful, visual conversations with close friends. With these new sticker tools, you have even more ways to turn your most casual, everyday moments into something fun to share.

Turn your selfie into a sticker that you can use throughout your story. You‚Äôll see a new sticker with a camera icon that lets you capture a mini-selfie. Before or after capturing, tap to apply different frame styles. Put your selfie sticker anywhere, adjust the size and use as many other creative tools as you want. You can also now pin your selfie sticker ‚Äî as well as any other sticker or text ‚Äî to a specific spot in your video. Just tap and hold the sticker, move it over any object and confirm by tapping ‚ÄúPin.‚Äù 

If you live in or are traveling to Chicago, London, Madrid or Tokyo, you‚Äôll also start seeing geostickers for your city over the coming days. All of the geostickers have been designed by local community members to help bring the cities they call home to life. You‚Äôll be able to see the artist‚Äôs username when you tap the sticker, so you can learn more about their unique artwork.

We‚Äôre also rolling out a shortcut to get to your favorite stickers. After tapping the smiley face, simply swipe right to see your recently used stickers. Finally, when you record a video using ‚ÄúHands-Free‚Äù mode, tap and hold the button to see a timer that counts down to when the video begins.

Texts and reshares will now appear in the same thread with disappearing photos and videos so you can seamlessly go back and forth with your friends.

Send a disappearing photo or video to let your friends know what you‚Äôre up to, a funny selfie to capture the mood or share what‚Äôs happening around you. Simply swipe left into Direct and tap the new blue camera icon at the bottom to take a disappearing photo or video, or tap the blue camera icon in an existing thread. As always, swiping right from feed will take you directly to the camera. Tap the arrow to send it to individual friends or groups of friends.

When you receive new disappearing messages, they‚Äôll be highlighted blue in your inbox. Tap to view them and you can replay them once. The sender will be notified if you replay or screenshot the message. Texts, uploads and reshares still work the same way. Since our last update in November 2016, the number of people using Direct has grown from 300 million to 375 million. We want to make Direct the best place to have fun, visual conversations with your friends. Stay tuned for more.

162454007121996_1496268013740582,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPhowicreate

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos documenting your creative process ‚Äî the why, the when and even the deeper question of how. San Francisco-based architect Dan Hogman (instagram.com/danhogman) tackles these questions during his sketching work: ‚ÄúArchitecture brings a sense of stability and timelessness,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBefore you get into the discussion on what it means or how it functions, a basic question is always current ‚Äî how to represent it? How to capture the essence in just a few strokes, whether it‚Äôs a single structure or a citywide scene,‚Äù says Dan, who makes daily drawings of settings and buildings that inspire him.

Here‚Äôs how to get started on your own submission this weekend: 

Document what happens when you sit down at the literal (or figurative) drawing board. When you put pen to paper ‚Äî or brush to canvas ‚Äî show what emerges, and how. 

Try exploring beyond what you might consider a typical creative process. How does a child line up her crayons? A bike repairman lay out his tools? Take note of the not-so-obvious creativity happening around you.

Experiment with different ways of capturing a creative process ‚Äî like a Hyperlapse of a mural coming to life or a Boomerang of an artist at work in her studio.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhowicreate hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The first step is to celebrate the kindness our community is already known for. On March 25 and 26, Instagrammers will come together for the kindness-themed Worldwide InstaMeet 15. Join an InstaMeet near you ‚Äî or spread kindness by leaving an encouraging comment, giving an inspiring person a like or sharing a message of support with a friend.

As part of our goal to build a safe environment, we also have some updates to announce. Soon you may notice a screen over sensitive photos and videos when you scroll through your feed or visit a profile. While these posts don‚Äôt violate our guidelines, someone in the community has reported them and our review team has confirmed they are sensitive. This change means you are less likely to have surprising or unwanted experiences in the app. If you‚Äôd like to see a post that is covered with a screen, simply tap to reveal the photo or video. 

Our teams are focused on making Instagram a kind, welcoming place for everyone, and we‚Äôre just getting started.

Age really is just a number. This weekend, head out into the world and capture playful, candid photos and videos showing how life is better when we keep a touch of whimsy in every day.
Here‚Äôs how to get started:
Turn the mundane into the magical by observing daily scenes through the eyes of a child. Clouds become animals, the ground turns to lava and a cardboard box lets you travel through time. 
Have you kept any mementos from your own childhood? Take a video, Boomerang or multi-post to show their presence and meaning. 
Just grab your camera and be joyful. Be spontaneous. Be silly! We could all do with taking ourselves a little less seriously.
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPyoungatheart hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

That really teaches you a lot about yourself.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Tasty specialties, lively characters or singular sights ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre going far from home or just down the block, what do you connect with in a new place? 

Observe the traveling that may be going on around you, like passengers boarding a ferry or a flock of birds migrating.

Since introducing stickers in December, we‚Äôve loved seeing how you‚Äôve used them to bring your stories to life ‚Äî from hats to Valentine‚Äôs Day fun to customizable location stickers. Now, with more than a dozen new stickers each for New York City and Jakarta, you have another creative option for adding context to your everyday moments.

When you take a photo or video and tap the sticker icon, you‚Äôll see geostickers at the top. No matter where you are in New York City or Jakarta, you‚Äôll see a custom sticker for that city. You may see other stickers appear when you‚Äôre visiting select neighborhoods and landmarks ‚Äî each one is designed to match the vibe of the location it represents.

You can add as many stickers as you want, adjust their size and placement and mix and match with other creative tools. Just like the customizable location sticker, people watching your story can tap a geosticker to see the location page. Your story won‚Äôt show up on the location page itself.

As you‚Äôre exploring these cities, keep an eye out for stickers you can use. We can‚Äôt wait to bring you more creative tools soon.

Starting today, you can share up to 10 photos and videos in one post on Instagram. With this update, you no longer have to choose the single best photo or video from an experience you want to remember.

When uploading to your feed, you‚Äôll see a new icon to select multiple photos and videos. It‚Äôs easy to control exactly how your post will look. You can tap and hold to change the order, apply a filter to everything at once or edit one by one. These posts have a single caption and are square-only for now. 

On a profile grid, you‚Äôll notice the first photo or video of a post has a little icon, which means there‚Äôs more to see. And in feed, you‚Äôll see blue dots at the bottom of these posts to let you know you can swipe to see more. You can like and comment on them just like a regular post.

This update is available as part of Instagram version 10.9 for iOS in the Apple App Store and for Android on Google Play.

The goal this weekend is to find faces in surprising and unexpected places ‚Äî like this one by Olaf Breuning (instagram.com/olafbreuning). Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Slow down and take in your surroundings. Look down at the sidewalk for shapes that resemble facial expressions; turn your attention up to find faces in buildings, clouds and trees.

Change your perspective ‚Äî sometimes a face is revealed when you turn your view sideways or rearrange the food on your plate.

Use stickers and Instagram Stories drawing tools to add props and personality to a face that you found in the wild, then share the creation to your feed.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPiseefaces hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

At home? Capture candid moments that demonstrate the closeness among people (or pets) who share downtime together.

Find the tiny gestures of love from everyday life, like a thoughtfully packed school lunch, a couple commuting together or a neighborhood group gathering to clean up a beloved park.

Be on the lookout for love in unexpected places like spotting the shape of a heart in a tree.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that get creative with the concept of disguise.

Here‚Äôs how to get started: 

Think of the ways your subjects can be camouflaged: mimicking the shape of a building, dressed in the pattern of the wallpaper behind them or matching the color scheme of their environment. 

Get playful with props and disguise everyday objects as a whimsical creature with homemade costumes. 

If your subject is well concealed, consider using Boomerang or video to reveal someone hiding in plain sight (like a friend peeking out behind a forest tree). 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdisguise hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos inspired by the diverse qualities of light. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Play around with different ways light can draw attention to a figure or action ‚Äî such as a golden halo around a single person or multiple sources of light, adding depth to a scene.

Look for situations that are transformed by the position of the sun, like a tree-lined promenade that sings at sunset.

Don‚Äôt shy away from shooting at night, when beams of light can become subjects in their own right. For example: car headlights that illuminate falling snow. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfollowthelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1402683189765732,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPimitation

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos where one of your subjects imitates another.

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Look out for resemblances between people and their surroundings. Be ready to catch fleeting, serendipitous encounters, like a woman in a yellow dress dashing past a yellow cab.

Capture an imitation that provides more information about your subject‚Äôs relationship, like a child copying an admired adult or a parrot impersonating their human‚Äôs eccentricities.

Explore less obvious forms of mimicry like patterns, gestures or, if you‚Äôre making a video, sound.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPimitation hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

No matter where you are or what you‚Äôre up to, you can add context to your story with stickers. After you‚Äôve taken a photo or video, you‚Äôll see a new stickers button next to the text and drawing tools. Tap the smiley face to find customizable stickers for weather, the current time and even your location. It‚Äôs easy to make stickers your own: move them around, make them bigger or smaller and choose from different styles to match your mood. And you can add as many stickers as you want to any part of your story.

You‚Äôll see a set of holiday stickers available for the next few weeks, and keep an eye out for even more stickers to ring in the new year!

You‚Äôll also find three other improvements: a new ‚ÄòHands-Free‚Äô option in the format picker lets you record a video without having to press and hold; you can add as many pieces of text as you‚Äôd like to a photo or video; and, on iOS, you can save your entire story to your camera roll as a single video.

In September, I shared our commitment to keeping Instagram a positive place for self-expression with the introduction of a keyword filter for comments. Today, I‚Äôd like to tell you about new commenting features that we‚Äôre launching. 

In the coming weeks, you‚Äôll be able to turn off comments on any of your posts. Previously this was only available for a small number of accounts. You‚Äôll be able to tap ‚ÄúAdvanced Settings‚Äù then select ‚ÄúTurn Off Commenting.‚Äù You can also tap the ... menu any time after posting to turn comments back on. Also, we‚Äôre adding the ability to like comments by tapping a heart icon next to any comment. Liking lets you show support and encourages positivity throughout the community. 
These updates still mark the beginning. We will continue to work to maintain Instagram as a welcoming and safe place for everyone. 

To learn more about these tools and others, check out the Instagram Help Center: https://help.instagram.com/196883487377501.

162454007121996_1354781967889188,"Weekend Hashtag Project: WHPthisishome

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that capture the essence of home.

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Show what makes a place feel familiar or comfortable ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs your morning routine at your favorite coffee shop or details of a house that remain unchanged for years.

Who are the people in your hometown that bring it to life? Take portraits of family, neighbors, friends or small-business owners who always make you feel welcome.

Try using Boomerang or video to capture homespun traditions like playing a favorite board game or the antics of a family pet.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPthisishome hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

Live video on Instagram Stories helps you connect with your friends and followers right now.

It‚Äôs easy to go live ‚Äî just swipe right from feed to open the camera, tap the ‚ÄúStart Live Video‚Äù button and start sharing for up to an hour. Your friends may get a notification when you go live so they can tune in. While you‚Äôre live, you can pin a comment for everyone to see or turn comments off altogether. When you‚Äôre done, your live story disappears from the app so you can feel more comfortable sharing anything, anytime.

When someone you follow starts a live video, you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúLive‚Äù under their profile photo in the stories bar. During the broadcast, you can comment and like as much as you want. You can also discover new live videos on Explore. Tap ‚ÄúTop Live‚Äù to see exciting live videos happening at that moment.

Live video on Instagram Stories and Explore will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks.

Now you can send disappearing photos and videos directly to groups and individual friends in a spontaneous, pressure-free way. Swipe right into the camera to take a photo or video, then tap the arrow to send it privately. You can choose a group or create one in just a few taps ‚Äî and you can also send to individual friends at the same time. Send anything you want, from inside jokes to your worst selfies. Unlike other messages in Direct, these photos and videos disappear from your friends‚Äô inboxes after they have seen them. And you‚Äôll see if they replayed it or took a screenshot.

To open your inbox, tap the new paper airplane icon at the top right corner of your feed or swipe left. You‚Äôll see disappearing photos and videos in a bar at the top. Tap the ones with blue rings to see what your friends sent you. In a group, you can see everyone‚Äôs responses ‚Äî and who else has seen them ‚Äî in a slideshow format. Then when you‚Äôre done, just tap their faded profile photo to send a quick response.

Disappearing photos and videos in Instagram Direct will start rolling out globally today.

The goal this weekend is to capture movement in creative ways.

Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Bring energy to your creation, whether you‚Äôre photographing subjects in motion or recording from a moving perspective, like the seat of a bustling train.

Keep an eye out for dynamic scenes like a busy intersection or a street festival, or find a friend who can bring an everyday scene to life with movement, such as choreography, skateboarding or hula-hooping.

Use Hyperlapse, Boomerang or the slo-mo setting on your phone to add drama or a twist to the movement you‚Äôre capturing.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/153057452937/161111-whp248

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinmotion hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured Boomerang by @jackarribas,video,http://trib.al/zo9ivA7,2016-11-11 18:50:32,75,9,0,71,1,0,3,0,0,0

Boomerang lets you turn everyday moments into something fun and unexpected. Now you can easily take a Boomerang right inside Instagram. Swipe right from your feed to open the stories camera. A new format picker under the record button lets you select ‚ÄúBoomerang‚Äù mode.

You can also now share who you‚Äôre with or who you‚Äôre thinking of by mentioning them in your story. When you add text to your story, type ‚Äú@‚Äù followed by a username and select the person you‚Äôd like to mention. Their username will appear underlined in your story. And when someone taps the mention, they'll see a pop-up that takes them to that profile.

You may begin to spot ‚ÄúSee More‚Äù links at the bottom of some stories. This is a test that lets verified accounts add links so it‚Äôs easy to learn more. From your favorite chefs‚Äô recipes to articles from top journalists or concert dates from the musicians you love, tap ‚ÄúSee More‚Äù or swipe up to view the link right inside the app.

162454007121996_1313211875379531,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPinthestudio

The goal of this weekend‚Äôs hashtag project is to photograph the places you or a fellow artist go to be creative. The project takes inspiration from London-based artist and guest curator Helen Downie (instagram.com/unskilledworker), best known for her fashion-inspired portraits and paintings.

Here are Helen‚Äôs tips to get started:

Show off your unique studio space. ‚ÄúConcentrate on how important it is to have your own area ‚Äî outside, inside, wherever, somewhere where you can just be,‚Äù says Helen. ‚ÄúI think that everybody needs that.‚Äù

Photograph artists working, focusing on how different locations inspire people differently. ‚ÄúI sit in one chair to sketch. And then I go upstairs to a very small room to paint. And it‚Äôs always the same,‚Äù Helen says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just habit.‚Äù

Experiment with Hyperlapse and Boomerang to capture the artistic process, whether a painting coming to life or behind the scenes of a photo shoot in video form.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinthestudio hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: http://blog.instagram.com/post/152130044647/161021-whpinthestudio

162454007121996_1275042352529817,"When Mike and I first created Instagram, we wanted it to be a welcoming community where people could share their lives. Images have the ability to inspire and bring out the best in us, whether they are funny, sad or beautiful. Over the past five years, I‚Äôve watched in wonder as this community has grown to 500 million, with stories from every corner of the world. With this growth, we want to work diligently to maintain what has kept Instagram positive and safe, especially in the comments on your photos and videos.

The beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people ‚Äî from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more ‚Äî call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It‚Äôs not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it‚Äôs also our responsibility as a company. So, today, we‚Äôre taking the next step to ensure Instagram remains a positive place to express yourself.

The first feature we‚Äôre introducing is a keyword moderation tool that anyone can use. Now, when you tap the gear icon on your profile, you‚Äôll find a new Comments tool. This feature lets you list words you consider offensive or inappropriate. Comments containing these words will be hidden from your posts. You can choose your own list of words or use default words we‚Äôve provided. This is in addition to the tools we‚Äôve already developed such as swiping to delete comments, reporting inappropriate comments and blocking accounts.

We know tools aren‚Äôt the only solution for this complex problem, but together we can work toward keeping Instagram a safe place for self-expression. My commitment to you is that we will keep building features that safeguard the community and maintain what makes Instagram a positive and creative place for everyone.

International Day of Friendship is on July 30, and to celebrate, this weekend‚Äôs goal is to make photos and videos that capture every aspect of friendship ‚Äî like this one by @bonosurfdog. Here‚Äôs how to get started:
 
Grab a friend or a group and take a fun selfie that shows what it‚Äôs like when you spend time together. Try using Boomerang to add motion.
 
A horse who hangs with a duck? A puppy cuddle puddle? Share a photo of your pets or an animal odd couple.
 
Find letters from pen pals, care packages, friendship bracelets and any other tokens you have that mean friendship to you. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfriendshipis hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1218121464888573,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPilluminate
 
The goal this weekend is to make videos of interesting sources of light at night. Here‚Äôs how to get started:
 
Attend a fireworks show, concert or another event with large displays of moving or colorful lights. Try turning off your flash when you shoot to highlight the contrast between light and dark areas in your videos.
 
Try experimenting with a portable light source ‚Äî like a sparkler, glow stick or flashlight ‚Äî to create an interesting pattern for your video by moving the lights around in your frame.
 
Rather than shooting video of your light sources directly, try also looking around for subjects or areas the light is hitting in a striking way, like the flickering glow of a campfire on a friend‚Äôs face.
 
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPilluminate hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to look for patterns in your surroundings, both naturally occurring and man-made. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Focus on highlighting the repetition of identifiable shapes in your scene.

Look for patterns large and small in scale ‚Äî whether zooming in close to the subtle lines on a flower petal or photographing the smokestacks of an industrial site from a distance.

Try using video to capture moving patterns ‚Äî like a line of ants marching in unison through your backyard.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPpatterns hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1132160746817979,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPsightsandsounds

The goal this weekend is to make videos with interesting ambient (or natural) sound, like this one by @hummingbirdsxoxo. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

Close your eyes and let your ears lead you to your subject.

Listen for sounds that set the mood ‚Äî like the upbeat squeak of sneakers sliding on a basketball court or the calming tones of church bells ringing in the morning.

Let the ambient noise guide the visual component of the video. For example, try panning your camera to slowly reveal the source of sound at the end.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsightsandsounds hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/140049205497/160226-whp-211
