The goal this weekend is to make photographs and videos of the people, places and things that inspire you.

Show your muse. Whether it’s the fashionable friend who pushes you to try new styles or your grandfather, whose handwritten cookbook houses all your family’s favorite recipes, show us who (or what) has inspired you to step up your game or try something new.

Take us there. A striking sunrise makes an early morning hike worth the wake-up time. A new exhibit at a museum can push you to revisit your love of painting. Share the locations that motivate you to step outside your comfort zone.

Honor the inspired work. Have a piece of art or new hobby with a story? Show us what you’ve created, and tell us what encouraged you in your caption.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinspired hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

When viewing a photo message from a friend, tap the camera icon at the bottom and capture a reply. Your reply includes a sticker of what you’re replying to. Move and resize it, and add your own twist with stickers, text and drawings. You can remix photos back and forth for a fun visual of your conversation.

Additionally, you can now also control replays. Choose “One View” for messages you want your friends to only see once. For everything else, choose “Allow Replay” so your friends have more time to view your messages. Photos and videos sent with “Allow Replay” loop automatically and your friends can tap and hold to pause.

These updates are available as part of Instagram version 24 for iOS and version 24 on Android.

Going live with a friend is now even easier. Starting today, when a friend is live, you can let them know you’d like to join in the fun and hang out live together.

When watching a friend’s live video, simply tap the “Request” button in the comments section. You’ll see a confirmation that your friend has accepted your request, and you’ll have a moment to prepare. Once you’re live, the screen will split in half so you can hang out live with your friend. You can leave your friend’s live video at any time, making it easy to join for a quick hello or a longer chat.

When hosting your own live video, you can easily see requests from friends who want to join. In the comments section, you’ll see a notification for each request. Just tap the “View” button and then choose to add your friend or cancel the request.

The new icon with two smiley faces will also have a red number showing how many requests you have. Tap the icon, and you’ll see both requests and current viewers. You can either accept a request or invite a viewer to join you. 

As always, you can remove a guest and add someone else at any time. When you’re done, you can share your live video to stories, or choose “Discard” and your live video will disappear from the app as usual. 

Going live together is the best way to connect in real time and have fun with friends, even when you’re not together. With this update, friends have even more ways to quickly join each other’s live videos.

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of the people, places and things you are most grateful for in your everyday life, as in this featured photo by Natalie Chitwood (instagram.com/natchitwood). Here are some tips to get you started:

Make portraits of the people that matter to you most — from a best friend to a mentor, a coach or a parent. Furry companions count, too! 

How do you express your thankfulness through action? Capture the ways you show that you’re grateful to those around you, like baking cookies for family or volunteering time to help your community. 

Use your captions to give meaning and context to your photos and videos. Well-chosen words can make a photograph even more powerful.

Light, camera, action! This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that showcase light in beautiful and diverse ways, as in this featured photo from Nadia (www.instagram.com/laporterouge). Here are some tips to get you started:

Light transforms ordinary scenes into extraordinary ones. Take a photo of the morning light as it pours into your kitchen, or during a sunset stroll. 

Have an outdoor portrait session with a friend. Try going during the golden hour, or find a perfectly and naturally illuminated wall to use as your backdrop.

Play with time and light together by photographing the same subject in the morning, afternoon and evening. Use multi-post to show how the light changes the scene throughout the day.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfindthelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Superzoom is an easy way to record a funny video with dramatic sound effects. When you open the camera, you’ll see “Superzoom” next to “Boomerang” under the record button. Tap “Superzoom” and then tap record to automatically zoom in with suspenseful music. 

You’ll also see a new set of spooky face filters in the camera. Get into the Halloween spirit by turning yourself into a zombie or getting lost in a mysterious fog. You can also add Halloween stickers to your photos and videos as a final touch.

Some things are just better together. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture duos that complement and enhance each other, as in this featured photo from Mark Abramson (instagram.com/markabramsonphoto). Here are some tips to get you started:

A hammock and a book, coffee and bagels, two best friends — some things just naturally go together. As you go about your weekend, take photos of some of your own perfect pairs.

Not every match is so simple! Keep an eye out for more surprising duos — much like this pedestrian and matching billboard — that might be hidden in plain sight. 

Once you’ve found an interesting pairing, how can you use camera tools to further enhance the match? Try taking a #Boomerang of two running buddies or a video of a dog and cat strolling through your backyard.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperfectpair hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured photo by @markabramsonphoto,link,https://trib.al/Xl0UGDZ,2017-10-20 16:10:51,113,8,7,97,7,2,0,0,1,6

As you go about your routine, note the shapes, shadows and colors you pass by. What details stand out when you pay attention?

Take portraits of the people you regularly spend time with, like your family, friends, neighbors and co-workers. 

A picture is worth a thousand words. Use your camera to explain a part of your daily life and culture to someone who lives on the other side of the world.

Change is in the air. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos capturing the signs of a new season, as in this featured photo from Daniel Taipale (instagram.com/dansmoe). Here are some tips to get you started: 

Whether you’re in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern, nature transforms the landscape this time of year. Head outside to seek inspiration in your surroundings — from the fiery reds and oranges of fall to the bright greens and blues of spring. 

What are your favorite activities in the upcoming season? Show us how you welcome the new season through traditions like autumn pumpkin-carving or planting a new garden. 

Reflect on what other transitions are taking place in your life, from new classes to new sports seasons.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPseasons hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Whether you’re trying to plan tomorrow’s outfit, choosing which class to take or figuring out where to go for dinner, now it’s easy to share a two-option poll right in your story.  After you’ve taken a photo or video for your story, select the “poll” sticker and place it anywhere you’d like — you can write out your own question and even customize the poll choices.

After you’ve shared your poll, your friends and followers can immediately start voting and see real-time results. Once someone has voted on your poll, they’ll see which choice is in the lead at any given moment. And if they watch your story again later, they’ll see the latest results.

To see your own poll results, swipe up to open the viewers list for that part of your story. Not only will you see how many votes each option received, but you’ll also see who voted and what option they chose. That way, you’ll be able to compare votes from the friends and followers whose opinions you trust most. And just like your story, your poll and its results will disappear after 24 hours.",Introducing Polls in Instagram Stories,link,https://trib.al/F1brkfY,2017-10-03 10:06:22,128,28,20,113,6,4,2,0,1,2

162454007121996_1712158278818220,"Today, we’re announcing new tools and programs to keep Instagram a safe and positive place for self-expression. Since the beginning, we’ve tried to make Instagram a welcoming place for everyone. Our community has grown to 800 million, with 500 million using it every day. It’s more important than ever to strengthen our commitment to safety and kindness.

Comment Controls

Over time, we’ve launched a number of tools to help you manage the comments experience, and today we’re introducing more. Starting today, if your account is public, you’ll see a new way to choose who can comment on your posts — from everyone to just groups of people, like people you follow or your followers. Also, whether your account is public or private, you’ll be able to block other accounts from commenting on your posts. In June, we launched a filter to block certain offensive comments in English, today we are expanding this filter to Arabic, French, German and Portuguese. The filter will improve over time, enabling the community’s experience of sharing to improve as well. 
  
Anonymous Reporting for Live Video

We’re continuing to provide mental health resources to you when you need them most. If you see someone going through a difficult time or in need of support during a live broadcast, you can report it anonymously. The person will see a message offering help with options to talk to a helpline, reach out to a friend or get other tips and support. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to respond.

Kindness Walls and Stickers

Over the next few months, we’re turning walls in cities around the world into colorful murals inspiring #KindComments. Visit a wall, take a photo or video and share a #KindComment to make someone’s day. You can also participate by using a new kindness-themed heart-shaped sticker. Both the murals and stickers are created by artists from the global community. 

We feel as strongly about creating a safe and welcoming environment today as we did when our community was just getting started. To learn more about these tools and others, visit Instagram-Together.com. Thank you for being on this journey with us, and for taking care of each other.

Ready, set, go! This week, the goal is to create photos and videos that capture energy and movement, as in this featured photo by Filipe Costa (instagram.com/filipefoto). Here are some tips to get you started:

Use Instagram’s creative tools to showcase kinetic energy in your daily life. Try a Boomerang of a morning running group or a Hyperlapse of an arena filling up with fans. Or make a Rewind in Instagram Stories of your dog playing fetch then share your video to your feed. 

Decide on a type of movement you want to focus on — sporting events, urban commutes, fall activities like apple picking — and go get in on the action. Let your camera lens draw your eye toward the most animated parts of the setting. 

Consider a scene that might at first glance appear calm and still. Where can you find the subtle forces of energy, and how can you highlight them in a single image?

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdynamic hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

You won’t find idle hands here. This weekend, the goal is to create photos and videos that highlight a passion or hobby you put your time and heart into, like this handmade floral hoop art by Olga Prinku (instagram.com/olgaprinku). Here are a few tips to get you started:

Show us your creative process, from the very beginning to the finished product. What steps take you from idea to object?

Whether you create for a living or for fun, every artist has his or her preferred space to work. Give us a tour of the place where you create — your kitchen table, your studio or a local crafting workspace.

Inspiration comes in all shapes and sizes — from communing with nature to experiencing the work of other artists. Where do you find yours?

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmadewithlove hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Nothing inspires creation quite like the beauty of nature. This weekend, the goal is to head outside and capture moments celebrating the great outdoors, as in this featured photo by Austin MacKay (instagram.com/austin.mackay). Here are some tips to get you started:

Are you heading out this weekend for some camping, hiking or biking? No matter what hemisphere you live in, the seasons are hinting at change, making it the perfect time of year to get outside. Take photos of your favorite moments.

The outdoors come in many shapes and sizes, from a backcountry trek to a small urban garden. Show us your own slice of nature, big or small. 

Getting outside can often require a fair amount of preparation and consideration — packing gear, studying maps and preparing food. Show us your process through videos and Boomerangs. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgreatoutdoors hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured photo by @austin.mackay,link,http://trib.al/ytdYybf,2017-09-01 16:03:56,279,30,9,256,18,3,0,0,2,0

Time travel, outer space, a parallel universe — the goal this weekend is to bring your wildest dreams to life through surreal photos and videos, like this one by @TKTK. Wherever your reveries take you, here’s how to get started: 

Create dreamlike compositions with textures such as gauzy curtains, or seek out otherworldly settings, like a foggy morning or a reflective pond.

Does fantasy inspire your makeup and fashion choices (or even those of a pet)? Show off your most imaginative styles, or create a new personality and a look to match.

Start in your Instagram Stories camera to experiment with transforming the world around you with tools like stickers and face filters, and then share your favorite creation to your feed.

Magic happens in the kitchen. This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of the good food and better company you find in the kitchen, as in this featured photo by Hedi Gharrat (www.instagram.com/h.rebel). Here are some tips to get you started:

Visit the kitchens where your favorite meals are made: Re-create a family recipe at a relative’s house, capture the tried and true pots and pans hanging above your kitchen sink or the scars on a friend’s cheese board at Friday night dinner.

People tend to gather in a home’s kitchen. Record Boomerangs or videos that capture the energy of a group of family members and friends around food and drink.

Kitchens don’t have to exist between four built walls. What are some nontraditional, makeshift kitchens you found yourself in this weekend, like a street food cart or a campfire?

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinthekitchen hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that show off a talent or passion — like this video by Nico Frank (instagram.com/nicofrankfb) showing off some fingerboarding flips. Whether your talent shines on paper, in motion or in some other medium, here’s how to get started:

Highlight how you’ve added your own personality to a skill, or taken what you’ve learned to a new level — such as adding custom art to your musical instrument, or adding a new step to a dance routine.

It doesn’t matter if you’ve taken lessons for years or if you’re self-taught, use your caption to celebrate your progress and how far you’ve come.

On a sports field or in the studio, think about how you can use your surroundings to frame your talent to tell more of your personal story.

This weekend, the goal is to create photos and videos that show duplicates of different people, places and things, like in this image by @yagazieemezi. Here are some tips to get you started:

Keep your eyes peeled for repeating patterns, be it on clothing, in food or in nature. You might be surprised how many colors and shapes you find.

Use product tools to highlight duplicates — a dog digging holes in the sand in Rewind, a Boomerang of a friend juggling a handful of lemons or a Hyperlapse of office workers strolling by, all dressed in suits and carrying briefcases.

Create your own intentional scene of multiplicity. Try dressing friends and pets alike at home, or create a work of art with echoing themes and colors. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmultiply hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

This weekend, the goal is to let shining, sparkling light catch your eye. Here are some tips to get you started:

Look for pops of light against a dark background — fireworks, sparklers and bonfires included. Don’t forget to check out what the light is touching, as well as the light itself. 

Focus on the shine of different surfaces and textures, whether you’re in a building made of glass or on the shores of a lake watching the sunset sparkle off the water. 

Use Boomerangs or videos to capture the movement of a sparkle as it bounces around a room.

162454007121996_1615363648497684,"Today, we’re introducing two comment filters to help keep Instagram a safe place for self-expression: an offensive comments filter and a spam filter. These tools are the next step in our commitment to foster kind, inclusive communities on Instagram. 

Many of you have told us that toxic comments discourage you from enjoying Instagram and expressing yourself freely. To help, we’ve developed a filter that will block certain offensive comments on posts and in live video. You can turn this filter off in the “...” settings menu from the profile and scroll to tap “Comments.”  We’ll launch this in English first, but will offer it in more languages over time. The spam filter removes any obvious spam in comments written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Chinese.

These filters are powered by machine learning, trained by our team to recognize certain types of offensive and spammy comments so you never have to see them. They will improve over time, enabling the community’s experience to improve as well. 

Our work is far from finished and perfect, but I hope we’re helping you feel safer and more welcome on Instagram.

Your profile is a representation of who you are and evolves with you over time. With Archive, you now have more flexibility to shape your profile while still preserving moments that matter.

To archive a post you’ve already shared, tap “...” at the top of the post and choose “Archive.” You’ll still be able to see it when you tap the Archive icon in the top right corner of your profile. That way, you can always return to these posts and see previous likes and comments from friends. If you change your mind about a post you’ve archived, tap “Show on Profile” at any time and it’ll show up in its original spot.

With this update, you now have a space just for you, where you can revisit moments without having to keep them all on your profile.

To learn more about Archive, visit the Instagram Help Center help.instagram.com/136706673552668.

These updates are available as part of Instagram version 10.21 and above for iOS in the Apple App Store and for Android in Google Play.

162454007121996_1592548024112580,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPfriendship

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture the many aspects of friendship. Here are a few tips to get you started:

Consider the different ways that friendship can be represented — not just through photos of friends themselves, but how relationships manifest in objects and actions. Take a photo of a thoughtful gift you were given, or a Hyperlapse of a helpful friend painting your kitchen with you. 

Show friends coming together, from gathering around the dinner table for a shared meal to a pickup soccer game. 

Keep an eye out for surprising or unlikely friendships: a dog and a cat snoozing together in a sunspot, a vine reaching out for a neighboring tree or a child embracing her new toy.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfriendship hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured photo by @harlis_gie,link,http://trib.al/6sdId9D,2017-06-09 18:02:23,164,11,8,152,8,1,1,1,1,0

You’ll see a new story ring at the top of Explore filled with stories happening near you. You can also search for any location around the world, and you’ll see a story ring for that place at the top of the location page. 

We’re also beginning to introduce hashtag stories on Explore. When you search for a hashtag, you may see a story ring at the top of the page filled with stories using that hashtag.

Add a location sticker or hashtag to your story and you may be included in the larger story. If you want to use a location or hashtag sticker but don’t want your story to appear on Explore, tap the X on your stories viewer list.

From discovering new parts of your hometown to jogging alongside the #fromwhereirun community, location and hashtag stories help you share these experiences as they unfold.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall! This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of reflections, both man-made and naturally occurring. 

Here are tips to get you started:

Notice reflections in all different surfaces around you. Whether it’s a freshly polished mirror, a cup of coffee or a smooth lake, there are reflections ready to be captured everywhere.

Play with different forms of photography. A reflection that’s full of life and motion is an opportunity to experiment with Boomerang, reverse video or Hyperlapse. 

Pay attention to light and how it changes throughout the day. This will affect the brightness, quality and movement of the reflections you see around you. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPreflections hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

There’s no place like home. This weekend, the goal is to celebrate home in all its forms — the people, the places, the things — and what makes them feel special.

Here are some tips to get started:

Take a portrait of your parents, siblings or the loved ones you grew up with. Work to tell their story in a single photograph. 

Notice the little details. Whether it’s your mother’s favorite books lined up on the shelf, the table that you’ve eaten dinner around since you were a child or a tire swing in the front yard, consider the specific elements that make it feel like home. 

Get creative with video to capture the smells, sounds and tastes of your hometown. How can you show what you would otherwise have to be there to experience?

Your dreams encapsulate your highest goals. This weekend, the goal is to capture that reach-for-the-stars feeling with photos and videos. 

Here are some tips to get started: 

Are you training to run your first marathon? Take a video that moves along your favorite route. Starting your own business? Capture the process of making the goods you’ll sell with a Boomerang.

Notice other people around you who are working to achieve their dreams. You’ll see that successes big and small are happening all around every day — a daughter graduating from university, a baby taking their first step — if you only take the time to look. 

Document your own dreams that have already come true. Photograph your newly purchased home or a plane ticket to a destination that changed your life.

162454007121996_1541384835895566,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPgoodnight

For some, the world goes to sleep at night. For others, it comes alive. This weekend, the goal is to capture both sides of that spectrum: the bright energy and the quiet rest.

Here are some tips to get you started:

Whether it’s calming down or speeding up, notice how the energy shifts. Document your family settling in for dinner or take a Boomerang of your friends hitting the town. 

Focus on light. Whether it’s the blue hue of dusk spreading over your neighborhood or a city skyline illuminated against the night sky, notice how light changes and evolves from bright to dim. 

Look beyond your immediate circle — how do other people react to the shift from day to night? Take a portrait of a server heading to work or a video of downtown streets emptying as office workers head home.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgoodnight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

Our planet is a timeless source of discovery, wonder and inspiration. This weekend, let’s celebrate Earth’s beauty. 

Here are a few tips to get you started:

Spend time in a majestic landscape. Mountains, beaches, plains, forests — our land is diverse and grand, and it would take lifetimes to experience it all. How much can you capture within the frame of one photograph or video? Look for action and movement within the larger scene.

Focus on the smaller details. Our planet may be vast, but there are millions of tiny, beautiful moments playing out in front of us every day: a blooming flower pushing through the cracks in the sidewalk, a trickle of water feeding a small pool in the forest or a tree swaying gently in the breeze. 

Keep an eye out for how nature weaves its way into man-made scenes. City and country alike have their own elements of natural beauty.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnaturalbeauty hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

You can create and name a new collection when you save a post, or you can add it to one you’ve already created. You can also create a collection out of your existing saved posts. Tap the plus icon in the top right corner, give your collection a name and select the saved posts you’d like to add. 

You can find your collections on the saved posts tab on your profile. Just like all saved posts, your collections are private — only you can see them. Since we introduced the ability to save posts last December, 46 percent of Instagrammers have saved at least one post. Whether you want to plan your next day trip, revisit your favorite artists’ illustrations or always have some animal videos on hand, collections can help you keep track of the posts you want to remember.

Over 200 million people now use Instagram Stories every day to keep up with friends and accounts they love. And with recent updates to Direct, it’s never been easier to have playful, visual conversations with close friends. With these new sticker tools, you have even more ways to turn your most casual, everyday moments into something fun to share.

Turn your selfie into a sticker that you can use throughout your story. You’ll see a new sticker with a camera icon that lets you capture a mini-selfie. Before or after capturing, tap to apply different frame styles. Put your selfie sticker anywhere, adjust the size and use as many other creative tools as you want. You can also now pin your selfie sticker — as well as any other sticker or text — to a specific spot in your video. Just tap and hold the sticker, move it over any object and confirm by tapping “Pin.” 

If you live in or are traveling to Chicago, London, Madrid or Tokyo, you’ll also start seeing geostickers for your city over the coming days. All of the geostickers have been designed by local community members to help bring the cities they call home to life. You’ll be able to see the artist’s username when you tap the sticker, so you can learn more about their unique artwork.

We’re also rolling out a shortcut to get to your favorite stickers. After tapping the smiley face, simply swipe right to see your recently used stickers. Finally, when you record a video using “Hands-Free” mode, tap and hold the button to see a timer that counts down to when the video begins.

162454007121996_1514074561959927,"Today, we’re launching the new Direct to make it fast and easy to turn any conversation into a visual conversation with photos and videos. Texts and reshares will now appear in the same thread with disappearing photos and videos so you can seamlessly go back and forth with your friends.

Send a disappearing photo or video to let your friends know what you’re up to, a funny selfie to capture the mood or share what’s happening around you. Simply swipe left into Direct and tap the new blue camera icon at the bottom to take a disappearing photo or video, or tap the blue camera icon in an existing thread. As always, swiping right from feed will take you directly to the camera. Tap the arrow to send it to individual friends or groups of friends.

When you receive new disappearing messages, they’ll be highlighted blue in your inbox. Tap to view them and you can replay them once. The sender will be notified if you replay or screenshot the message. Texts, uploads and reshares still work the same way. Since our last update in November 2016, the number of people using Direct has grown from 300 million to 375 million. We want to make Direct the best place to have fun, visual conversations with your friends. Stay tuned for more.

162454007121996_1496268013740582,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPhowicreate

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos documenting your creative process — the why, the when and even the deeper question of how. San Francisco-based architect Dan Hogman (instagram.com/danhogman) tackles these questions during his sketching work: “Architecture brings a sense of stability and timelessness,” he says. “Before you get into the discussion on what it means or how it functions, a basic question is always current — how to represent it? How to capture the essence in just a few strokes, whether it’s a single structure or a citywide scene,” says Dan, who makes daily drawings of settings and buildings that inspire him.

Here’s how to get started on your own submission this weekend: 

Document what happens when you sit down at the literal (or figurative) drawing board. When you put pen to paper — or brush to canvas — show what emerges, and how. 

Try exploring beyond what you might consider a typical creative process. How does a child line up her crayons? A bike repairman lay out his tools? Take note of the not-so-obvious creativity happening around you.

Experiment with different ways of capturing a creative process — like a Hyperlapse of a mural coming to life or a Boomerang of an artist at work in her studio.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhowicreate hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The first step is to celebrate the kindness our community is already known for. On March 25 and 26, Instagrammers will come together for the kindness-themed Worldwide InstaMeet 15. Join an InstaMeet near you — or spread kindness by leaving an encouraging comment, giving an inspiring person a like or sharing a message of support with a friend.

As part of our goal to build a safe environment, we also have some updates to announce. Soon you may notice a screen over sensitive photos and videos when you scroll through your feed or visit a profile. While these posts don’t violate our guidelines, someone in the community has reported them and our review team has confirmed they are sensitive. This change means you are less likely to have surprising or unwanted experiences in the app. If you’d like to see a post that is covered with a screen, simply tap to reveal the photo or video. 

Our teams are focused on making Instagram a kind, welcoming place for everyone, and we’re just getting started.

While live videos will continue to disappear from the app when you’re done, this update gives you the flexibility to hold onto your video and re-watch it later, especially if something exciting happens during your broadcast that you want to remember or share.

After your live broadcast ends, tap Save in the upper right corner. You’ll only be able to save your video — not the comments, likes, number of viewers or any live interactions. After saving, tap Done and your live video will be saved to your camera roll but will no longer be available in the app.

Age really is just a number. This weekend, head out into the world and capture playful, candid photos and videos showing how life is better when we keep a touch of whimsy in every day.
Here’s how to get started:
Turn the mundane into the magical by observing daily scenes through the eyes of a child. Clouds become animals, the ground turns to lava and a cardboard box lets you travel through time. 
Have you kept any mementos from your own childhood? Take a video, Boomerang or multi-post to show their presence and meaning. 
Just grab your camera and be joyful. Be spontaneous. Be silly! We could all do with taking ourselves a little less seriously.
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPyoungatheart hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that re-create the experiences of traveling — like this multi-image post from Sam Vox’s (instagram.com/sam.vox) journeys. “I’m the guy with the camera and notepad ready to learn about people,” says Sam, a photographer who travels throughout Tanzania. “When you talk to strangers you meet on the streets or on the train, some share the most touching stories, and you find yourself opening up as well to them, sharing your own life story in a way you never thought you would. That really teaches you a lot about yourself.”

Here’s how to get started:

Tasty specialties, lively characters or singular sights — whether you’re going far from home or just down the block, what do you connect with in a new place? 

Observe the traveling that may be going on around you, like passengers boarding a ferry or a flock of birds migrating.

Combine multiple videos and photos in a single post to share the story of a weekend trip.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPtravelogue hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1468697253164325,"Today, we’re introducing an early version of geostickers in Instagram Stories for New York City and Jakarta. Since introducing stickers in December, we’ve loved seeing how you’ve used them to bring your stories to life — from hats to Valentine’s Day fun to customizable location stickers. Now, with more than a dozen new stickers each for New York City and Jakarta, you have another creative option for adding context to your everyday moments.

When you take a photo or video and tap the sticker icon, you’ll see geostickers at the top. No matter where you are in New York City or Jakarta, you’ll see a custom sticker for that city. You may see other stickers appear when you’re visiting select neighborhoods and landmarks — each one is designed to match the vibe of the location it represents.

You can add as many stickers as you want, adjust their size and placement and mix and match with other creative tools. Just like the customizable location sticker, people watching your story can tap a geosticker to see the location page. Your story won’t show up on the location page itself.

As you’re exploring these cities, keep an eye out for stickers you can use. We can’t wait to bring you more creative tools soon.

Starting today, you can share up to 10 photos and videos in one post on Instagram. With this update, you no longer have to choose the single best photo or video from an experience you want to remember.

When uploading to your feed, you’ll see a new icon to select multiple photos and videos. It’s easy to control exactly how your post will look. You can tap and hold to change the order, apply a filter to everything at once or edit one by one. These posts have a single caption and are square-only for now. 

On a profile grid, you’ll notice the first photo or video of a post has a little icon, which means there’s more to see. And in feed, you’ll see blue dots at the bottom of these posts to let you know you can swipe to see more. You can like and comment on them just like a regular post.

The goal this weekend is to find faces in surprising and unexpected places — like this one by Olaf Breuning (instagram.com/olafbreuning). Here’s how to get started:

Slow down and take in your surroundings. Look down at the sidewalk for shapes that resemble facial expressions; turn your attention up to find faces in buildings, clouds and trees.

Change your perspective — sometimes a face is revealed when you turn your view sideways or rearrange the food on your plate.

Use stickers and Instagram Stories drawing tools to add props and personality to a face that you found in the wild, then share the creation to your feed.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPiseefaces hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

In honor of Valentine’s Day, celebrated around the world on February 14, this weekend’s goal is to create photos and videos that show what love means to you. 💗 Here’s how to get started:

At home? Capture candid moments that demonstrate the closeness among people (or pets) who share downtime together.

Find the tiny gestures of love from everyday life, like a thoughtfully packed school lunch, a couple commuting together or a neighborhood group gathering to clean up a beloved park.

Be on the lookout for love in unexpected places like spotting the shape of a heart in a tree.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPloveis hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that get creative with the concept of disguise.

Here’s how to get started: 

Think of the ways your subjects can be camouflaged: mimicking the shape of a building, dressed in the pattern of the wallpaper behind them or matching the color scheme of their environment. 

Get playful with props and disguise everyday objects as a whimsical creature with homemade costumes. 

If your subject is well concealed, consider using Boomerang or video to reveal someone hiding in plain sight (like a friend peeking out behind a forest tree). 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdisguise hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1410073892359995,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPfollowthelight

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos inspired by the diverse qualities of light. Here’s how to get started:

Play around with different ways light can draw attention to a figure or action — such as a golden halo around a single person or multiple sources of light, adding depth to a scene.

Look for situations that are transformed by the position of the sun, like a tree-lined promenade that sings at sunset.

Don’t shy away from shooting at night, when beams of light can become subjects in their own right. For example: car headlights that illuminate falling snow. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfollowthelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos where one of your subjects imitates another.

Here’s how to get started:

Look out for resemblances between people and their surroundings. Be ready to catch fleeting, serendipitous encounters, like a woman in a yellow dress dashing past a yellow cab.

Capture an imitation that provides more information about your subject’s relationship, like a child copying an admired adult or a parrot impersonating their human’s eccentricities.

Explore less obvious forms of mimicry like patterns, gestures or, if you’re making a video, sound.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPimitation hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1387411991292852,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPcometogether
The goal this weekend is to capture what brings your family and friends together. Here’s how to get started:
What are the activities that a family gathering wouldn’t be complete without? Share photos or videos of the traditions you look forward to each year, and explain what makes them special in the caption.
Capture the tone of your event with a candid moment that encapsulates its mood — whether celebratory, relaxed or silly.
Using Instagram Stories, try our new drawing tools and stickers to get more creative with your submission, and share a favorite moment to feed with the hashtag.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPcometogether hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1384813571552694,"Today, we’re introducing a set of tools to help you add context and creativity to your story: stickers, holiday fun and more.

No matter where you are or what you’re up to, you can add context to your story with stickers. After you’ve taken a photo or video, you’ll see a new stickers button next to the text and drawing tools. Tap the smiley face to find customizable stickers for weather, the current time and even your location. It’s easy to make stickers your own: move them around, make them bigger or smaller and choose from different styles to match your mood. And you can add as many stickers as you want to any part of your story.

You’ll see a set of holiday stickers available for the next few weeks, and keep an eye out for even more stickers to ring in the new year!

You’ll also find three other improvements: a new ‘Hands-Free’ option in the format picker lets you record a video without having to press and hold; you can add as many pieces of text as you’d like to a photo or video; and, on iOS, you can save your entire story to your camera roll as a single video.

In September, I shared our commitment to keeping Instagram a positive place for self-expression with the introduction of a keyword filter for comments. Today, I’d like to tell you about new commenting features that we’re launching. 

In the coming weeks, you’ll be able to turn off comments on any of your posts. Previously this was only available for a small number of accounts. You’ll be able to tap “Advanced Settings” then select “Turn Off Commenting.” You can also tap the ... menu any time after posting to turn comments back on. Also, we’re adding the ability to like comments by tapping a heart icon next to any comment. Liking lets you show support and encourages positivity throughout the community. 
These updates still mark the beginning. We will continue to work to maintain Instagram as a welcoming and safe place for everyone. 

To learn more about these tools and others, check out the Instagram Help Center: https://help.instagram.com/196883487377501.

162454007121996_1354781967889188,"Weekend Hashtag Project: WHPthisishome

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos that capture the essence of home.

Here’s how to get started:

Show what makes a place feel familiar or comfortable — whether it’s your morning routine at your favorite coffee shop or details of a house that remain unchanged for years.

Who are the people in your hometown that bring it to life? Take portraits of family, neighbors, friends or small-business owners who always make you feel welcome.

Try using Boomerang or video to capture homespun traditions like playing a favorite board game or the antics of a family pet.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPthisishome hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1349599141740804,"Today we’re announcing two updates: live video on Instagram Stories and disappearing photos and videos for groups and friends in Instagram Direct.

Live video on Instagram Stories helps you connect with your friends and followers right now.

It’s easy to go live — just swipe right from feed to open the camera, tap the “Start Live Video” button and start sharing for up to an hour. Your friends may get a notification when you go live so they can tune in. While you’re live, you can pin a comment for everyone to see or turn comments off altogether. When you’re done, your live story disappears from the app so you can feel more comfortable sharing anything, anytime.

When someone you follow starts a live video, you’ll see “Live” under their profile photo in the stories bar. During the broadcast, you can comment and like as much as you want. You can also discover new live videos on Explore. Tap “Top Live” to see exciting live videos happening at that moment.

Live video on Instagram Stories and Explore will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks.

To learn more about live video on Instagram Stories, check out the Instagram Help Center: https://help.instagram.com/1660923094227526",,video,https://www.facebook.com/InstagramEnglish/videos/1349599141740804/,2016-11-21 13:01:42,494,77,401,437,32,20,3,0,2,0
162454007121996_1349598968407488,"Today we’re announcing two updates: live video on Instagram Stories and disappearing photos and videos for groups and friends in Instagram Direct.

Now you can send disappearing photos and videos directly to groups and individual friends in a spontaneous, pressure-free way. Swipe right into the camera to take a photo or video, then tap the arrow to send it privately. You can choose a group or create one in just a few taps — and you can also send to individual friends at the same time. Send anything you want, from inside jokes to your worst selfies. Unlike other messages in Direct, these photos and videos disappear from your friends’ inboxes after they have seen them. And you’ll see if they replayed it or took a screenshot.

To open your inbox, tap the new paper airplane icon at the top right corner of your feed or swipe left. You’ll see disappearing photos and videos in a bar at the top. Tap the ones with blue rings to see what your friends sent you. In a group, you can see everyone’s responses — and who else has seen them — in a slideshow format. Then when you’re done, just tap their faded profile photo to send a quick response.

Disappearing photos and videos in Instagram Direct will start rolling out globally today.

162454007121996_1338903436143708,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPinmotion

The goal this weekend is to capture movement in creative ways.

Here’s how to get started:

Bring energy to your creation, whether you’re photographing subjects in motion or recording from a moving perspective, like the seat of a bustling train.

Keep an eye out for dynamic scenes like a busy intersection or a street festival, or find a friend who can bring an everyday scene to life with movement, such as choreography, skateboarding or hula-hooping.

Use Hyperlapse, Boomerang or the slo-mo setting on your phone to add drama or a twist to the movement you’re capturing.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/153057452937/161111-whp248

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinmotion hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.",Featured Boomerang by @jackarribas,video,http://trib.al/zo9ivA7,2016-11-11 18:50:32,75,9,0,71,1,0,3,0,0,0

162454007121996_1337009829666402,"Today, we’re introducing a few new tools to help you make your story even more fun: Boomerang and mentions. We’re also starting to test links inside some stories.

Boomerang lets you turn everyday moments into something fun and unexpected. Now you can easily take a Boomerang right inside Instagram. Swipe right from your feed to open the stories camera. A new format picker under the record button lets you select “Boomerang” mode.

You can also now share who you’re with or who you’re thinking of by mentioning them in your story. When you add text to your story, type “@” followed by a username and select the person you’d like to mention. Their username will appear underlined in your story. And when someone taps the mention, they'll see a pop-up that takes them to that profile.

You may begin to spot “See More” links at the bottom of some stories. This is a test that lets verified accounts add links so it’s easy to learn more. From your favorite chefs’ recipes to articles from top journalists or concert dates from the musicians you love, tap “See More” or swipe up to view the link right inside the app.

The goal of this weekend’s hashtag project is to photograph the places you or a fellow artist go to be creative. The project takes inspiration from London-based artist and guest curator Helen Downie (instagram.com/unskilledworker), best known for her fashion-inspired portraits and paintings.

Here are Helen’s tips to get started:

Show off your unique studio space. “Concentrate on how important it is to have your own area — outside, inside, wherever, somewhere where you can just be,” says Helen. “I think that everybody needs that.”

Photograph artists working, focusing on how different locations inspire people differently. “I sit in one chair to sketch. And then I go upstairs to a very small room to paint. And it’s always the same,” Helen says. “It’s just habit.”

Experiment with Hyperlapse and Boomerang to capture the artistic process, whether a painting coming to life or behind the scenes of a photo shoot in video form.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinthestudio hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1275042352529817,"When Mike and I first created Instagram, we wanted it to be a welcoming community where people could share their lives. Images have the ability to inspire and bring out the best in us, whether they are funny, sad or beautiful. Over the past five years, I’ve watched in wonder as this community has grown to 500 million, with stories from every corner of the world. With this growth, we want to work diligently to maintain what has kept Instagram positive and safe, especially in the comments on your photos and videos.

The beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people — from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more — call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It’s not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it’s also our responsibility as a company. So, today, we’re taking the next step to ensure Instagram remains a positive place to express yourself.

The first feature we’re introducing is a keyword moderation tool that anyone can use. Now, when you tap the gear icon on your profile, you’ll find a new Comments tool. This feature lets you list words you consider offensive or inappropriate. Comments containing these words will be hidden from your posts. You can choose your own list of words or use default words we’ve provided. This is in addition to the tools we’ve already developed such as swiping to delete comments, reporting inappropriate comments and blocking accounts.

We know tools aren’t the only solution for this complex problem, but together we can work toward keeping Instagram a safe place for self-expression. My commitment to you is that we will keep building features that safeguard the community and maintain what makes Instagram a positive and creative place for everyone.

International Day of Friendship is on July 30, and to celebrate, this weekend’s goal is to make photos and videos that capture every aspect of friendship — like this one by @bonosurfdog. Here’s how to get started:
 
Grab a friend or a group and take a fun selfie that shows what it’s like when you spend time together. Try using Boomerang to add motion.
 
A horse who hangs with a duck? A puppy cuddle puddle? Share a photo of your pets or an animal odd couple.
 
Find letters from pen pals, care packages, friendship bracelets and any other tokens you have that mean friendship to you. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfriendshipis hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

162454007121996_1218121464888573,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPilluminate
 
The goal this weekend is to make videos of interesting sources of light at night. Here’s how to get started:
 
Attend a fireworks show, concert or another event with large displays of moving or colorful lights. Try turning off your flash when you shoot to highlight the contrast between light and dark areas in your videos.
 
Try experimenting with a portable light source — like a sparkler, glow stick or flashlight — to create an interesting pattern for your video by moving the lights around in your frame.
 
Rather than shooting video of your light sources directly, try also looking around for subjects or areas the light is hitting in a striking way, like the flickering glow of a campfire on a friend’s face.
 
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPilluminate hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

You’ll also see updated icons for our other creative apps: Layout, Boomerang and Hyperlapse.

We’ve made improvements to how the Instagram app looks on the inside as well. The simpler design puts more focus on your photos and videos without changing how you navigate the app. 

The Instagram community has evolved over the past five years from a place to share filtered photos to so much more — a global community of interests sharing more than 80 million photos and videos every day. Our updated look reflects how vibrant and diverse your storytelling has become. 

Thank you for giving this community its life and color. You make Instagram a place to discover the wonder in the world.

As people share more videos than ever before, we’re making it easier to discover the ones you’ll love. To begin, you’ll find a personalized channel called “Videos You Might Like” that collects videos from across Instagram’s global community into a seamless viewing experience. 

Even with these changes, Explore still works the same way: The more you like, the better Explore gets, adjusting to your preferences and showing you more of the stuff you enjoy. And if you see something you don’t like, tap “See Fewer Posts Like This” in the ‘...’ menu to make your Explore experience even better. 

To start, these updates to Explore will only be available in the United States. We’re working to bring this to the rest of the world soon.

The goal this weekend is to look for patterns in your surroundings, both naturally occurring and man-made. Here’s how to get started:

Focus on highlighting the repetition of identifiable shapes in your scene.

Look for patterns large and small in scale — whether zooming in close to the subtle lines on a flower petal or photographing the smokestacks of an industrial site from a distance.

Try using video to capture moving patterns — like a line of ants marching in unison through your backyard.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPpatterns hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

You realize the gauntlet we have set up in this process to become president,” he says, revealing just one of the things that goes on onstage but behind the cameras: “During commercial breaks, a lot of the candidates come up to the desk and work the refs a little bit … ‘I’m not getting enough questions,’ etc.”  Bret knows what his goal for the night is though: creating informative moments — the ones he aims to foster are “substantive but fiery.”

The goal this weekend is to make videos with interesting ambient (or natural) sound, like this one by @hummingbirdsxoxo. Here’s how to get started:

Close your eyes and let your ears lead you to your subject.

Listen for sounds that set the mood — like the upbeat squeak of sneakers sliding on a basketball court or the calming tones of church bells ringing in the morning.

Let the ambient noise guide the visual component of the video. For example, try panning your camera to slowly reveal the source of sound at the end.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsightsandsounds hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/140049205497/160226-whp-211

I’ve always had an interest in photography; I think it came from people taking photos of me. I like to show bright colors in my photographs, and I’m looking for a really clear subject. My father is Noel Gallagher [from the rock band Oasis], so perhaps one would associate me with more outlandish photos. But I live life like a normal 16-year-old and I want my feed to show that — it wouldn’t be normal for me to just post photos of my dad! I like seeing what other 16 year olds are up to and having my own voice for the causes I work for, like animal rights and bullying. It’s helped me come to terms with the fact I do personally make a difference. 

Tomorrow night I’m attending the BRIT Awards and can’t wait to share what it’s like to be there!”

Since launching video two years ago and introducing Hyperlapse and Boomerang, you’ve made video storytelling on Instagram take off. Whether sitting front row at Fashion Week or spending a day on the beach, nothing brings moments to life like video.

So what I try to do instead is work unique ideas, uncommon moves you don’t see all the time.” Canadian-born Scott studied martial arts as a child, and when he was 15 he started practicing flips at a gym also used by some Cirque du Soleil performers. It was there Scott was exposed to different circus disciplines, like hand balancing and aerial arts, learning firsthand what happens behind the scenes. “Circus hurts,” he says. “It’s beautiful to watch, but it takes a lot of training.”

On farmland on the North Island of New Zealand, a picturesque, pint-sized tourist attraction originally built by the team who brought “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” movies to life, is a fantasy come true for fans.

Stephen Poon’s (instagram.com/an_amaze_ing_view) playful, spherical photos of the beloved village manage to capture part of Hobbiton’s magic: “The picture with the round, yellow door in Hobbiton almost looks like a photo of a little planet,” Stephen, who currently lives in Qatar, says. “But Hobbiton is like that. It’s another world, just built at a smaller scale than ours.”

“Visiting it is always one of my favorite parts of being in NYC for New Year’s Eve, there’s really no experience like it,” says Ryan, who is in from Los Angeles, taking his place as host of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve for the 11th year running. “In person [the ball] is smaller than you’d expect given how large it looks from the street and on TV, but it’ll still dwarf you when you’re standing next to it.
